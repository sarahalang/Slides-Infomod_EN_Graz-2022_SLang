These are my slides for the English version of the course "Introduction to Information Modelling".
It contains a theoretical intro to modelling in the DH but then moves on to put this into practice. 
In the class, students will read on the topic, pick a Humanities original to model and model this first in ER, then in SQL.
Beyond databases, the class usually includes an overview of other datatypes used in the DH and sessions on the topic of "messy data" in DH and using OpenRefine (not included in the slides in their current state).

Please don't look too closely yet as the code still needs cleaning up. As I have been receiving requests, however, I decided to push this to a public repo. Let me know if you spot any things that need correcting!
